# CPlusPlus
The program is supposed to analyze texts files that are generated throughout the day at a grocery store. The program is supposed to list all items purchased as well as the frequency it is bought. This will help the store see which items are the most popular and which ones aren't selling as much.
I couldn't do anything on this project particularly well. I was unsuccessul at correctly linking python to the c++ project.
In general, I can enhance my code by keeping it neat. Sometimes when I am writing a program I get lazy with the formatting which can make it a chore to read. Properly indenting my c++ code will make it much easier to read and understand. I can also add notes in the appropriate parts such as the start of functions.
When I find myself stuck on a particular part of a program I use google to figure out where I am going wrong. The internet is the best tool when it comes to finding programming help. I rarely run into issues that hasn't already been asked and answered online. the website stack overflow is tremendously helpful when it comes to programming questions, as well as redit and github.
Knowing how to properly link python to c++ is going to be very useful in the future. However, I still haven't been able to sucessfully do it. 
Adding proper comments and indenting it correctly makes the program easy to read.
